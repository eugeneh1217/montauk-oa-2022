# Scraping + Search Engine

Development Process

1. inspect page while it loads to find where it gets its data from: https://transparency-in-coverage.uhc.com/api/v1/uhc/blobs/
2. scrape and store data
	- decided to go with sqlite for development speed (database can be better decided further into design process)
